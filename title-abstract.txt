Title:
Political Polarization of Major News Networks on Twitter

Abstract:
We will construct a geometric definition of the political spectrum of major US news outlets through an unsupervised approach. We model the political alignments of the outlets in terms of pairwise political similarity among pairs of outlets using graphs and embed the graph onto a Euclidean space for result. We will be collecting hashtags used in the users' own timelines and cross reference it with the hashtags used during election period to classify their political stance as well as create a graph analysis between the news networks as a whole. Through this, we demonstrate the location where each news network lies on the U.S. political spectrum and how they lie relative in hashtag vector space to one another.
