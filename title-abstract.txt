Title:
Political Polarization of Major News Networks on Twitter

Abstract:
Many researches have tackled the alignment of political ideology of entities on social media. However, few have considered quantifying political ideology free of human heuristics. In this project we will construct a geometric definition of the political spectrum for twitter accounts of major news outlets using an unsupervised approach. We model the political alignments of the outlets in terms of pairwise political similarity among pairs of outlets using an undirected graph and embed the graph onto a 1-d Euclidean space for result. We will quantify pairwise similarity based on the hashtags used by users who recently retweeted the outlets in question. Through this, we construct a relative and unsupervised quantification of political alignment and produces consistent results that coincide with traditional conception of political leaning of news outlets.
